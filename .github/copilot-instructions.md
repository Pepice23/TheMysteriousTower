# Copilot Rules for Hybrid Blazor WASM inside WinForms Application

## Purpose

This Copilot rules file is intended to guide the use of GitHub Copilot for developing a hybrid Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) application inside a WinForms project. The objective is to use Copilot to explain concepts, teach, answer questions, plan, provide opinions, review, and assist in writing the program.

## Guidelines

### General Use

- Utilize Copilot to explain and teach C# concepts and Blazor WASM integration within WinForms.
- Ask Copilot questions related to C# programming, Blazor, and WinForms development.
- Use Copilot to plan out the project, including architecture, design, and implementation details.
- Request opinions and reviews from Copilot on code snippets, design choices, and implementation strategies.
- Follow Copilot's suggestions and ask for clarifications if the suggestions are not clear.

### Specific Use Cases

1. **C# Programming Assistance**

   - Use Copilot to generate code snippets for C#.
   - Ask Copilot to explain C# syntax and concepts.
   - Use Copilot to refactor and optimize C# code.

2. **Blazor WASM Integration**

   - Ask Copilot for guidance on integrating Blazor WASM with WinForms.
   - Use Copilot to generate Blazor components and pages.
   - Seek Copilot's advice on best practices for Blazor WASM development.

3. **WinForms Development**
   - Use Copilot to assist with WinForms UI design and event handling.
   - Ask Copilot for help with WinForms-specific tasks and controls.
   - Request Copilot to review WinForms code for improvements.

### Planning and Reviews

- Use Copilot to outline the project plan and milestones.
- Ask Copilot to review the project plan and provide feedback.
- Request Copilot to review code and suggest improvements.
- Use Copilot to conduct code reviews and provide constructive feedback.

### Best Practices

- Always review the code generated by Copilot before integrating it into the project.
- Use Copilot's suggestions as a learning tool to improve understanding of C#, Blazor, and WinForms.
- Encourage collaboration by sharing Copilot's suggestions with team members and discussing their implementation.

### Limitations

- Copilot is a tool to assist and enhance development, not a replacement for human decision-making.
- Validate all code and suggestions provided by Copilot to ensure they meet project requirements and standards.
- Use Copilot's suggestions as a starting point and customize them to fit the project's specific needs.

## Conclusion

By following these guidelines, you can effectively use GitHub Copilot to develop a hybrid Blazor WASM inside WinForms application. Utilize Copilot's capabilities to learn, plan, ask questions, review, and write the program, ensuring a successful and efficient development process.
